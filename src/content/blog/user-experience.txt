Why UX should be your top priority in any development project
and how to achieve excellent user experience.

User experience is not just about making things look pretty;
it's about creating interfaces that are intuitive, efficient,
and enjoyable to use.

Essential UX Principles:
- User-Centered Design
- Accessibility
- Performance
- Consistency
- Clear Feedback

Remember: The best interface is one that feels invisible to the user
while helping them achieve their goals efficiently.
