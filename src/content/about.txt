I vibecoded this vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS application with Cursor. My goal was to create an interesting site while exploring AI coding agents.

This site is hosted on an old laptop and served over a 4G connection. I was eager to host it myself and get my hands dirty with server setup and management. I had a Raspberry Pi in mind for hosting, but an old laptop lying around got a new life with a fresh Linux install to become my server.

I initially planned to serve it as a simple static site with Node.js or Go, but I opted for Nginx to learn more about it.

I'm using a Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the site on my domain, 'apbetioli.dev'. 

A cron job keeps the site updated by pulling from the GitHub repo periodically. The next step is to set up a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner to automate 'deployment' on every push to the main branch.

That's it for now. More to come soon.
