THERE AND BACK AGAIN
<i>A programmer's journey by Alexandre Betioli</i>

It all started with a simple quiz program written in a Windows 98 batch file. I spent countless hours exploring my computer's files, trying to understand how programs worked, with only a BASIC programming book as my guide.

When I discovered the Internet, my curiosity led me to game development. Starting with creating CounterStrike maps, I eventually built my first game: a quirky first-person shooter where you wielded a fish that shot fireworks. That's when I knew programming was my calling.

My first web project was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoblog" class="terminal-link" target="_blank">photolog</a> built with PHP and MySQL, designed to help my family share photos before Facebook existed. It was a simple platform where everyone could log in and post their memories.

After university, I had the privilege of working with various tech stacks, diverse teams, and different industries.

Outside my regular job, I always yearned to build something of my own. Together with my friend Thiago, we embarked on several ventures. We became finalists in the 2013 Google Cloud Developer Contest, earning a Nexus7 tablet. Later, we dove into indie game development and created a <a href="https://l9studios.com" class="terminal-link" target="_blank">Unity asset</a> that garnered over 200 sales in the Unity Asset Store. We even ventured into 3D printing, building our printers from scratch (a story that deserves its own post).

Life took an interesting turn when my son was born. Seeking more flexibility, I made a bold move: selling my house to fund my entrepreneurial journey. I studied marketing and launched a 3D printing YouTube channel with an online course. Running a one-person show proved challenging - creating content, editing videos, and handling marketing was overwhelming. That's when my wife Mariana joined the venture, taking charge of content creation while I focused on technology and marketing. Together, we built a <a href="https://mariubialli.com.br" class="terminal-link" target="_blank">learning platform</a> that attracted over 1,500 subscribers. We sustained the business for nearly three years until funds ran low, and I realized how much I missed being a full-time programmer.

Now I'm back in software engineering, excited about the possibilities ahead and ready to build remarkable things. Let's go!
